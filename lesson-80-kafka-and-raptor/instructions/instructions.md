# Instructions

## Introduction

The messaging lab contains a set of files.
Depending on the route we decide to take, not all the lab files are relevant.

This file contains links to the other files to make navigation easier.

Depending on the projects you are part of, you may want to focus on the messaging technology most relevant to you.

We will show you how to get the Kafka starter project to work.

### Steps

#### 1. Create the project starter

You can use Altus or Maven archetypes to create your starter project.

Again, we suggest using the archetype unless you know you want an Altus project to play with.

Here are your options (when following the instructions, make sure you select the Kafka options where prompted):

- [Create a message daemon using altus](CreateMessageDaemonAltus.md)
- [Create a message daemon using the maven archetype](CreateMessageDaemonUsingArchetype.md)

#### 2. Activate the archetype

Next we'll activate the Kafka archetype and test it.

- [Activate Kafka](kafka/ActivateArchetype.md)
